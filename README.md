## Description
Playing with maps, using GIS, [fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/manual.html), Basemap, shapefiles, with ample use of pandas Dataframe.

2 Days challenge, that I blew to overthink OSGB coordinates conversion, and amenities. But fun nonetheless.
Result in v1.1, badly needing refactoring, for later versions.

### mapPlot.py
 Main program to plot data from .xlsx into map from shapefile.
 .xlsx will have a column of data, a column of keyword, and a column of postcodes.

 - Calls [**scrape.py**](https://github.com/AndreaIdini/MapWorld#scrapepy) to select a range where a keyword appears, building a DataFrame with the data where keywords appears (e.g. London).
 - Calls then [**analyze.py**](https://github.com/AndreaIdini/MapWorld#analyzepy) to analyse the scraped dataset and build the index for the market analysis in function *calc_index(p,m)*. This particular instance uses OLS from last 4 years data to judge the quality of the market in a certain postcode. Proof of principle and fun.
 - Calls then **mapPlot.py** to plot from shapefile the area of same postcodes of .xlsx.

 Result is that if you write "London" you will have a map of all London districts of your data, divided by postcode. If you write Sheffield, a map of Sheffield...etc...

 NOTE: London area includes suburbs, such as Guildford. Results may not be as you are used to.

### scrape.py
 Scrape from Excel data tables finding intervals where string appears, in order to lookup postcode and data, and building the corresponding dataframe for the given range. This dataframe will be used by **mapPlot.py** to plot data

### analyze.py
Takes a DataFrame in input. The output is the same DataFrame with an added 'index' column with the following index.

It start by checking for column with dates, and extracting pure data.
Use then the time series to build an ordinary least square method (OLS) extrapolation, from which extracts slope *m*, intercepts *q*, and respective errors *sm*, *sq*.
This is motivated because most of the mortgage investments in London area for privates and SME follow a linearly growing trend, with some volatile noise in specific areas (that has a reason and can be accounted in the index).

At this point an index could be inspired by the least squares: *sign(m-<m>)(m-<m>)^2/<sm>^2* to signal how up-and-coming (or declining) an area is, the same function for the intercept *q* to show how traditionally strong it is, and *-(sm-<sm>)^2/<sm>^2* to penalize for the volatility of the investments going on in the area.

The method is crude, but 16 datapoints are not enough for a iterative regression (are barely enough for a decent OLS with covariance), the true jump in quality would be considering adjacent postcodes for a nearest (and next-to-nearest) neighbours calculation. Geographical complications of dealing with patches are not fit for a 2 days challenge, but worth considering.

### map.py
 Plot a basic geographical map, using functions in mapPlot.py, reading from a given shapefile.
 Usually works, especially if you use the mP function that is only patch--based.

## History and Datasets
Map downloaded from [UK borders data service](https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk/), license in directory. England map divided by postal code region.
These maps are in [OSGB coordinate reference system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid), that is NOT latitude and longitude, thus is not usable with the convenient Basemaps or any WGS84 continental map.
The most convenient conversion (precision of the conversion is down to Â± few meters), is with ogr2ogr, from GDAL package.

Script ./Map/convert_OSGBtoWGS84.sh is setup accordingly, check .prj file for [Proj4 parameters](http://proj4.org/parameters.html) to verify setup
