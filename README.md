## History and Datasets
Map downloaded from [UK borders data service](https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk/), license in directory. England map divided by postal code region.
These maps are in [OSGB coordinate reference system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid), that is NOT latitude and longitude, thus is not usable with the convenient Basemaps or any WGS84 continental map.
The most convenient conversion (precision of the conversion is down to Â± few meters), is with ogr2ogr, from GDAL package.

Script ./Map/convert_OSGBtoWGS84.sh is setup accordingly, check .prj file for [Proj4 parameters](http://proj4.org/parameters.html) to verify setup
